# OMicroN
Optimising microstructures numerically (OMicroN). Full field physics-based simulation package for metallic microstructure during treatments. The package includes solid state transformations (phase transformations, recrystallization, grain growth) as well as solute redistribution (carbon partitioning / diffusion / trapping to defects).
